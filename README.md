## WORKFLOW ##
1. Admins create evalutions and assign them to advisers or themselves. (council name, academic year (2023-2024), council adviser (selcet from admin oradviser users))
2. Advisers can see all evaluations assigned to them. Once assigned they can add students to their councils. They can also assign peer evaluators to the students. This evaluation serves as a container for evaluations. 
3. Evaluation has three criteria with their own weight. The Adviser evaluation should be filled by the assigned council adviser, the peer evalution should be by the assigned peer evaluators, and the self should be by the students. Students in the council are the ones to be evaluated.
